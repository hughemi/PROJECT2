                <h2>Australia, and the success they are having in reaching 80% double vaccination rates by the end of 2021</h2>
                <p id="paraFirst">Unlike many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa whose outlook looks concerning and needs additional help, the
                    outlook is quite the opposite in Australia. 
                    <br><br>Where 80% of a states 16+ y.o population is double vaccinated, freedoms such as international travel
                    and loosening of restrictions will be implemented. All states are on track to reach this figure by the end of 2021.
                    <br><br>The predictions in the dashed line are simple trend generates forecasts that will not be extremely accurate.
                    However, their purpose is serve as a rough guideline of when each state can expect to reach the 80% milestone.

                <p id="paraLeftPad">Currently Australia has roughly 62% double vaccination rates.
                    <br><br>The dashed lines are basic trend forecasts that serve as a guideline, and should not be taken seriously.
                    <br><br>However, Australia and all of its states should reach 80% rates by December.

                <p id="paraRollout"> Australia are contracted to receive 250 million doses by mid 2023.
                    <br><br> However, only 75M of those 250M are required to vaccinate the whole population,
                    & 100M will be supplied to the Pacific & Southeast Asia.
                    <br><br> This leaves Australia with an excess of 75M doses.
                    Should Australia look to donate some vaccines to other regions of need?

                    with some countries less than 1%, such as Cameroon, Chad, Ethiopia etc.
                    <br><br>Due to most African countries being low-income and not having access to vaccines, 
                    could they hold the world back from finally eliminating COVID and opening all borders?
                    <br><br>It is a real question that should be asked to all high-income, highly vaccinated countries.
                    Australia is already sending millions of vaccines to the Pacific and Southeast Asia which is great, but with our
                    extreme surplus of vaccines evidenced in previous graphs, should Australia look at assisting African countries as well?

                    Only Seychelles and Mauritius have rates over 25%.
                    <br><br>To understand how Africa & other regions are going, play with the filters.
                    The 'Rank Filter' ranks all countries double vaccination %, where 1 = the best in the world.
                    <br><br> Let's hope Australia will be able to reach 85%+ double vaccinated quickly and then
                    assist Africa in reaching this major milestone!
