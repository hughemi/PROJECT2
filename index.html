                <h2>A birds-eye view of COVID-19 double vaccination vates across the globe</h2>
                <p>Here we see a choropleth map of double COVID-19 vaccination rates for most countries.
                    <br><br> It seems that the higher income countries have better rates which is intuitive since they would 
                    have more access to vaccinations.
                    Africa is clearly struggling and may be continent the holds the world back from fully opening borders?

                <h2>Well are vacciantions rates at least increasing across the world?</h2>
                <p>This chart is overwhelming and largely uninterpretable without any filters applied to it. 
                    <br><br> Therefore, I would suggest to play with the 'Region' attribute through either clicking on 
                    the legend, or using the 'Region Selection'.
                    <br><br> The population filter allows you to look at larger population countries if you wish.
                    <br><br> Whilst the 'Rank filter' may be the most interesting. Move the slider and see what you think it means.
                    A countries 'Rank' was determined by ranking each countries most recent Double Vaccination %.
                    <br><br> The country that ranks 1st and dominates the rest of the world is Gibraltar,
                    and no their data is not lying, they really do have a vaccination rate of 117%.
                    This is because Gibraltar is a tiny country situated next to Spain, so many Spaniards got vaccinated in Gibraltar and boosted their numbers!
                    <br><br> On another note, Africa is clearly struggling with vaccinations rates less than 1% in some countries.

                <h2>How badly are regions of Africa failing to get their population vaccinated?</h2>
                <p>Highlighted in blue is Sub-Saharan Africa, which has the worse vaccination rates of any Region
                    <br><br> Sub-Saharan Africa is broken down into multiple subregions, as defined by the UN, with
                    Northern Africa currently being the subregion with the worse average double vaccination rates.
                    <br><br>However, what is interesting to note is that there are two bars for 'Northern Africa'.
                    The difference is that the parts of Northern Africa that lie in the region of Middle East
                    & North Africa, have much greater rates. The 3 countries that fit this criteria are Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia
                    who unsurprisingly have the 2nd, 5th and 13th greatest GDP in Africa, respectively.
                    <br><br> This suggests that a greater GDP is correlated with greater vaccination rates, but this would
                    have to be explored further.

                <h2>A refocus onto Australia and how close we are to the 80%, freedom, vaccination rate!</h2>
                <p>Unlike many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa whose outlook looks concerning and needs additional help, the
                    outlook is quite the opposite in Australia. 
                    <br><br>Where 80% of a states 16+ y.o population is double vaccinated, freedoms such as international travel
                    and loosening of restrictions will be implemented. All states are on track to reach this figure by the end of 2021.
                    <br><br>The predictions in the dashed line are simple trend generates forecasts that will not be extremely accurate.
                    However, their purpose is serve as a rough guideline of when each state can expect to reach the 80% milestone.
